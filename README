This is an unofficial set of files for James Bennett's 'Practical Django Projects' Second Edition, published by Apress. I have no connection with the author, the book or the publisher, but in the absence of any official example files I thought my finished set might be useful.

I have tracked down fixes for most of the things that don't work from the book, and added templates where examples are missing. Most things seem to work fine for me, but I can't guarantee it will work for you.

These files aren't designed to work as standalone applications -- they will probably need configuration and set-up, and assume you're following along with the book's tutorials and might just need a reference copy of the code.

Here are some things that don't work / might not work / will need attention:

### General

* You'll need to do some configuration in cms/settings.py
* No SQLite database is included -- the code should create one at cms/cms.db

### Coltrane

* In the weblog app, I'm not sure if Akismet works (it doesn't complain).
* In the weblog, sending emails after a comment is posted might not work (no complaint, but email doesn't seem to arrive when sent from my laptop).
* The bit that sends an email notification when a comment is posted needs a template at comments/comment_notification_email.txt so I've put that outside of the templates/cms/coltrane/ directory, inside templates/cms/.
* Setting up the tagging is problematic. This code currently works fine, but you may need to manually add the 'tags' column to your tables. http://blog.sveri.de/index.php?/categories/2-Django

I can't guarantee to ever update this code or supply help with problems (I hardly know what I'm doing myself), but you can post comments here: http://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/01/14/django.php
